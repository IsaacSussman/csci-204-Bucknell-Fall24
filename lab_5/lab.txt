- Best: O(1) vs O(1) Worst: O(n**2) vs O(n)
    - LinkedList is far better at Worst Case
- Best: O(1) vs O(1) Worst: O(n) vs O(n)
    - About equal in deleting
- Best: O(1) vs O(1) Worst: O(1) vs O(n)
    - ArrayList is far faster in the Worst Case
- LinkedList for fast insertions near end, ArrayList for fast access and equally fast beginning insertions
